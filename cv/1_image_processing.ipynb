    "In Python, OpenCV loads images as NumPy arrays. It allows you to use standard math operations on pixels.\n",
    "- Unlike almost every other library (which uses RGB), OpenCV loads images in BGR (Blue, Green, Red) order.\n",
    "- Coordinate System: The origin $(0,0)$ is the top-left corner. $X$ increases to the right, and $Y$ increases downward.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Image Processing Operations\n",
    "#### Thresholding (Binarization)\n",
    "This turns a grayscale image into a black-and-white image. It is the first step in object detection or OCR (text recognition).\n",
    "- **Simple Thresholding**: You pick a value (e.g., 127). Anything lighter becomes white; anything darker becomes black.\n",
    "- **Otsu’s Binarization**: Automatically calculates the best threshold value by looking at the histogram of the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Blurring (Smoothing)\n",
    "Used to reduce noise.\n",
    "- **Gaussian Blur**: Uses a mathematical kernel to weight nearby pixels more than distant ones.\n",
    "- **Median Blur**: Replaces a pixel with the median of its neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Edge Detection (Canny)\n",
    "The Canny Edge Detector is the most famous algorithm in CV. It finds areas where the intensity of pixels changes drastically.\n",
    "- **Noise Reduction**: Applies a blur.\n",
    "- **Gradient Calculation**: Finds the intensity slope.\n",
    "- **Non-maximum Suppression**: Thins out the edges.\n",
    "- **Hysteresis**: Decides which edges are \"strong\" and which are \"weak.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Morphological Transformations\n",
    "These are operations based on the image shape, usually performed on binary images.\n",
    "- **Erosion**: Erodes away the boundaries of foreground objects (makes white objects smaller).\n",
    "- **Dilation**: Adds pixels to the boundaries (makes white objects larger).\n",
    "- **Opening/Closing**: Used to remove noise from the background or fill small holes inside objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finding Contours in an Object\n",
    "1. Grayscale $\\rightarrow$ Blur $\\rightarrow$ Canny Edge (or Threshold).\n",
    "2. cv2.findContours(): This joins the edges into a continuous loop.\n",
    "3. cv2.drawContours(): Visualize the detected shapes."
