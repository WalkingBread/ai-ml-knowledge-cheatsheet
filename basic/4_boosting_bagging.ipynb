    "### Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)\n",
    "It aims to reduce Variance (overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works: \n",
    "1. **Bootstrap**: Take your dataset and create multiple random subsets with replacement. Some rows will be repeated, and some will be left out. \n",
    "2. **Train**: Train a separate model (usually a Decision Tree) on each subset independently and in parallel. \n",
    "3. **Aggregate**: For classification, take a majority vote. For regression, take the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Logic: \n",
    "- Since each tree sees a slightly different version of the data, they make different mistakes. When you average them, the individual errors (noise) cancel out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Random Forest Algorithm\n"

    "### Boosting\n",
    "It aims to reduce Bias (underfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "How it works:\n",
    "1. **Train**: Train a simple model (Tree 1) on the whole dataset. It will likely perform poorly.\n",
    "2. **Evaluate**: Identify the data points that Tree 1 got wrong (the residuals/errors).\n",
    "3. **Weight/Correct**: Train Tree 2 specifically to predict those errors.\n",
    "4. **Repeat**: Each subsequent tree tries to fix the \"mistakes\" of the previous ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Logic: \n",
    "- Instead of just averaging opinions, Boosting \"learns from its mistakes\" over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost."

    "### When to Use Which Technique\n",
    "- Use Bagging when your model is overfitting and has high variance, especially with decision trees.\n",
    "- Use Boosting when your model underfits and you want higher accuracy by learning complex patterns.\n",
    "- Use Bagging if:\n",
    "    - You have a small dataset or a lot of noise.\n",
    "    - You want a \"plug-and-play\" model that doesn't need much hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "    - You are worried about the model memorizing the noise (overfitting).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Boosting if:\n",
    "    - You have plenty of data and need maximum accuracy.\n",
    "    - The relationship between features is very complex.\n",
    "    - You have the time to tune parameters like learning_rate and max_depth."
